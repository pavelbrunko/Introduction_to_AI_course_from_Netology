### Introduction to AI from Netology

In this repository you can find some jupiter notebooks with practice of writing small neural networks.

1. Intro to AI. Hometask 1 / Hometask 1 (hard)

Here you can find the simplest vesrion of neural network - network with only one hidden layer. This model was build for realisation linear model. In hard homework also you can find a simplest linear model, but with a little more complicated data.

2. Intro to AI. Hometask 2 / Hometask 2 (hard)

In this notebook the main goal was to research the "Fisher's Iris" dataset, learn a classification model and measure it's quality. As a baseline the logistic regression model was taken. There are steps about data importing (or creating an artificial data in the second notebook), preprocessing data, building the model and mesuring it's quality. The second model was MLP with three hidden layers.

3. Intro to AI. Hometask 3_FlowerClassification / Homework 3 (hard)

In this part I tried to classify dataset with pictures of flowers using torchvision. I took alexnet model and replace the last layer to make the model more suitable for my dataset. In the second part I tried to use some method to avoid ovefitiing for my model
